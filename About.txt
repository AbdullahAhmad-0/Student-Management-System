Abdullah, Ahmad, Rizwan, Talha Sarwar, Asad Muzammil Jutt, Abdullah, and Fazal Abbas have collaborated to create a comprehensive student management system with various features and functionalities. Let's explore the key aspects of the system:

Forms: The student management system comprises multiple forms, including classes, student, attendance, fee, card generator, scanner, setting, log viewer. These forms enable efficient data entry, management, and configuration within the system.

Classes: The "Classes" form allows the users to manage different classes or academic years. It provides functionalities to add, update, and delete class information.

Student: The "Student" form allows users to manage student records. Users can add, update, and delete student information, including details such as name, roll number, father's name, contact information, code, technology, class, and shift.
